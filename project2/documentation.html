        The first thing that i worked on was getting the api to show more than one amiibo,
        which would allow me to get to work on the rest of the project. I then got to the css part for a bit
        to work on making sure the results were displayed in an appropriate manner. I then worked on the limit selector, which
        ended up taking me at least 30 minutes because I forgot that I copy and pasted the option values and
        the values were all set to 5 and I just changed the inner text and not the actual value itself.
        As I was working, I noticed that when I left the searchbar empty and clicked the search button, I
        would get every amiibo in the API's index, which I thought would be pretty nifty to have incase users
        would like to see what amiibo nintendo has.
        After that, I got to making my special feature, which was keeping recent searches. After the user types
        in a search term, it would be saved to an internal array and output the search terms when the recent searches
        button was clicked. I then modified it to get the recentSearches to store the 10 recent searches through localStorage,
        so that the array would still have the searches when the page is reloaded.

        <p>Grading:</p>
        I did not go further than what was expected of me. I believe I did enough to meet expectations. I believe the work that
        I did is at least worth a B or a B+ at most
